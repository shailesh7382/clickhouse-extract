Let&#x27;s bring back the $500 bill and then index the entire thing to inflation such that there isn&#x27;t more than a dozen or so steps between the smallest and largest monetary units.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is a political discussion&#x2F;argument we need to have constantly. Fix it once and then leave it alone. I&#x27;m also completely opposed to eliminating all currency and going totally electronic, which sounds like an even more dystopian state than the current one our betters have created for us over the last decade or two.","dead":0,"parent":11132443,"poll":0,"kids":[11132960],"url":"","score":0,"title":"","parts":[],"descendants":0}
